## Conventions

### General
* Take extra caution when interpreting moves as unnecessary moves, occupied moves or loaded moves.
  There might be a good other reason.

<!-- ### Fuming -->

<!-- ### Awkward -->
<!-- ### Conservative -->
<!-- ### Greedy -->
<!-- ### Picky -->
<!-- ### Spiteful -->
<!-- ### Insolent -->
<!-- ### Vindictive -->
<!-- ### Miser -->
<!-- ### Compulsive -->
<!-- ### Mood Swings -->
### Insistent
* Reverse finesses do not apply if it can be a forward finesse (unless the ability doesn't trigger).
### Quacker
* Players do not have to respect finesses that other (not-too-occupied) players can give as well.
* Treat all clues given by Quacker as loaded play clues
### Vulnerable
* Color saves are on for 5s, but not for 2s(?). However, they are play clues when it is loaded
  or occupied (but beware: two color clues in a row could be two color saves on 5s).
* Very early clues, when many other clues are available, can
<!-- ### Color-Blind -->
### Follower
* Can be finessed on cards which are not yet playable??
### Impulsive
* All clues on slot 1 are (of course) focus inversion / forward finesses.
<!-- ### Indolent -->
### Hesitant
* Slot 2 is their finesse position.
* This applies to finesses, bluffs, gentleman's discard, etc.
* If there is enough context that it is not slot 2, it is slot 1 (not slot 3).
* Layered finesses or stacked finesses go slot 2-1-3-4-5.
<!-- ### Anxious -->
<!-- ### Traumatized -->
<!-- ### Wasteful -->
### Genius
* Both clues should generally be a play clue, save clue, early save clue (on a critical known unplayable), tempo clue, or fix clue.
* On the first clue of the game, this is definitely not always the case.
  * The default interpretation is as follows:
    * non-1 + color: play the focus of the color clue, (early) save the number cards (assuming the color clue was given first)
    * 1 + color touching one of the 1s: gives tempo on the focus of the color clue (assuming 1 was given first)
    * 1 + color not touching a 1: early save on cards touched by color
  * The second clue is interpreted as a finesse if there is a clearly better clue available to Genius.

<!-- ### Panicky -->
<!-- ### Contrarian -->
### Stubborn
* The Stubborn player should respect that an out-of-order move is a priority bluff on the next player.
* Schrodinger's Cat principle applies: the Stubborn player should respect both possibilities.
* The player before the Stubborn player can discard rather than saving the Stubborn player.

### Blind Spot
* This is one of the characters that is hardest to play with for teammates.
* You can never bluff the player with Blind Spot.
* They always have to respect that it is a finesse on the next player.
* Can the player before Blind Spot bluff the player after Blind Spot? I think so, but it might be a true finesse?
* You can finesse the player with Blind Spot, but it will be slow, since they will wait a round for the next player to play into it.
  * Therefore, the player after the player with Blind splot should (almost) never hesitate into playing into finesses.
* You can't give a clue to the player with Blind Spot that is a reverse finesse on the player after the player with blind spot.

### Oblivious
* This is mostly hard for teammates. Don't forget that the Oblivious character cannot see one hand when making decisions!
### Slow-Witted
* Slow-witted finesses cards from slot 2 (of course)
* The clues by Slow-witted that doesn't touch chop focuses slot 2.
* If slot 1 is touched, it is not considered to be touched??
