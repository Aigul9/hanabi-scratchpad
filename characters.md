## Conventions

### General
* Take extra caution when interpreting moves as unnecessary moves, occupied moves or loaded moves.
  There might be a good other reason.

<!-- ### Insolent -->

<!-- ### Mood Swings -->
### Insistent
* Reverse finesses do not apply if it can be a forward finesse (unless the ability doesn't trigger).
### Quacker
* Players do not have to respect finesses that other (not-too-occupied) players can give as well.
### Vulnerable
* Color saves are on for 5s, but not for 2s(?). However, they are play clues when it is loaded
  or occupied (but beware: two color clues in a row could be two color saves on 5s).
<!-- ### Color-Blind -->
### Follower
* Can be finessed on cards which are not yet playable??
### Impulsive
* All clues on slot 1 are (of course) focus inversion / forward finesses.
<!-- ### Indolent -->
### Hesitant
* Slot 2 is their finesse position.
* This applies to finesses, bluffs, gentleman's discard, etc.
* If there is enough context that it is not slot 2, it is slot 1 (not slot 3).
* Layered finesses or stacked finesses go slot 2-1-3-4-5.
<!-- ### Anxious -->
<!-- ### Traumatized -->
<!-- ### Wasteful -->
### Genius
* Both clues should generally be a play clue, save clue, early save clue (on a critical known unplayable), tempo clue.
<!-- ### Panicky -->
<!-- ### Contrarian -->
### Stubborn
* The stubborn player should respect that an out-of-order move is a priority bluff on the next player.
* Schrodinger's Cat principle applies: the stubborn player should respect both possibilities.
<!-- ### Blind Spot -->
<!-- ### Oblivious -->
