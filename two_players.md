## Some 2p conventions with Libster

* Color Self Bluffs exist
* Early save on critical > self-finesse
* Tempo clue + early save on useful > self-finesse
* 7 clue stalls are on
* (known) priority bluffs are on in the endgame
* note to self: don't forget about trash order chop moves
* occupied single tempo clues always chop move
* non-critical chop saves > self-finesse if the card is valuable enough

#### Tough situations

* misplay chop = double cm, force clue if high clues
* skip discard = double cm, force clue always

#### Early game
* You have permission to discard unless you have received a chop 2-5. If you have permission to discard you cannot stall
* If you have a play, you are not allowed to stall
* If you received a on-chop number clue, you are required to stall
* If you received an off-chop stall, you are allowed to stall, but not required to. All non-1 number clues are stalls
* You can 5 stall if you are afraid to bomb (if the other player just played)

### Pink

* save + tempo clue > flush clue
* delayed pink positional clues: clue 1 for leftmost, 2 for 2nd, etc. However, early saves take priority!

* If all cards of a rank are playable, then every card clued with just that rank is playable
* Pink promise is holy
* Off chop stall clues in early game have their rightmost card as focus
* early game pink fixes:
  * 1 means fixed card is trash
  * pink doesn't touch any new cards
  * number is pink promise and touches the new cards
